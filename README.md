### Discovery

- Algorithms with best accuracy

|Algorithm|Data Type|Scale|Accuracy|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|___SVM (kernel = rbf)___|___Feature Scaled Data___|___0, 1___|___82 %___|
|___SVM (kernel = linear)___|___Nominal Data___|___0, 1, 2, 3, 4___|___77 %___|

### Expectation

- Predicted heart disease using 13 features

- Apply similar logic to other disease

- If these algorithms are applied to all disease, computer can diagnose probability of each disease with given features.

- Doctors will make better diagnosis with help of these algorithms applied to medical data.

### In the Future

- GitHub organization: `MedicalDataAnalysis`

- repository: `Heart_Disease-Wisconsin-`

- Plan to make repositories for other disease whenever we get the data

- Build medical platform using models we created
